This project is the final result of the **[Two Repositoy Method](https://github.com/JohnPothos/vite-test-page)** , where only the locally builded code is provided to github pages and triggers a static page creation.

Given the project's nature, the **GIT RESET** operation will precede any version upgrades.

## Version 1.0.0

Utilizing **React** ,**TailwindCSS** and **JSON Data** created a **Digital Hub** to organize and showcase some of the projects I am working on. The **Open Graph** protocol was implemented to make website media friendly.
