This project is the final result of the **[Two Repositoy Method](https://github.com/JohnPothos/vite-test-page)** , where only the locally builded code is provided to github pages and triggers a static page creation.

Given the project's nature, the **GIT RESET** operation will precede any version upgrades.

## Version 1.0.0

Utilizing **React** ,**TailwindCSS** and **JSON Data** created a **Digital Hub** to organize and showcase some of the projects I am working on. The **Open Graph** protocol was implemented to make website media friendly.

## Version 2.0.0

To implement multiple and distinct **Open Graph** headers for different pages in the application, utilized the **React Helmet** library

As the website expands with the addition of more pages , **React BrowserRouter** library was employed to synchronize **UI** with the **URL** and an animated transition effect has been implemented for error pages.
